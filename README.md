This Express App lets you sign up, upload images and description of your pets, saves results in a datbase. You can post comments, edit and delete them, as well as your posts. The app was created using Node JS, Express, MongoDB and being deployed via Heroku and MLab for database storage. This is my first attempt at back-end application, using knowledge I gained while doing Udemy's course - Web Dev Camp by Colt Steele.
